# CSC-VI-Application-Development-II---Final-Project---Video-Game-Tracker-Web-Application

This project will need a virtual environment, Python, Pylance, Pillow, and Django to run.
To run, just type "python manage.py runserver" into the python terminal. (I used vscode)

## About Project
This project is a video game tracker.
A user can create an account, sign in, and log out.
The user can also update their profile, update their game stats, and update their game library.
Multiple different post types can be created and comments can be made for a post.
There is a library of games to look through. Each game has a detailed page of information.

## What Went into Making the Project
I made this project at Carlow University during for my final of the Application Development II class in the Spring of 2025.
It contains Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used Django as the framework to wun the website.
The project was completed using the Agile development process. It was sectioned into 4 2-week sections. Each section I had to plan and complete within the timeframe.
I used AJAX to make the website show responsive changes. This way the user does not have to refresh the webpage in order to see posted comments, updated stats, etc..
